# Big-Integer-Implementation
Like the Big Integer class in java.math.BigInteger, this project allows for very large number multiplication and addition. 
The "Main.java" driver file is just a simple demonstration of the code working. With a validity check using the built in BigInteger class. 
For now, only positive integers are accepted arguements and subtraction and division are not impltemented.
